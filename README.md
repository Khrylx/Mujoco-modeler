# Mujoco Modeler
GUI for adjusting the geometry of Mujoco models

## How it works?
Use mouse right button to select a geometry of a bone or just the bone itself when it has no geometry. Then you can rotate, translate, change the size of
it. And you can also add new geometry to the bone or delete existing geometry. Currently it supports two types of geometry in Mujoco: **capsule** and **ellipsoid**.

## keyboard shortcuts
